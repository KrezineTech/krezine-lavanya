# ✅ Image Display Issues - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Images were not displaying properly in the product detail listings page.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the console output, the images were actually loading successfully. The issue was not with image loading but with:
1. Next.js optimization warnings
2. Missing priority settings for above-the-fold images
3. Aspect ratio warnings for styled images

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Next.js Configuration Warnings**
- Removed deprecated `images.domains` configuration
- Used only `images.remotePatterns` for all external domains
- Eliminated configuration deprecation warnings

### 2. **Enhanced Image Components**
- Added `priority={true}` for primary/header images (fixes LCP warning)
- Added explicit `style` props for fixed dimensions to maintain aspect ratio
- Added `priority={photo.isPrimary}` for photo grid primary images

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Implemented state-based error handling in PhotoGrid
- Added graceful fallbacks for failed image loads
- Enhanced header image with error state management

### 4. **Optimized Image Loading**
- Added proper `sizes` attribute for responsive images
- Used `unoptimized={true}` only for placeholder images
- Added `objectFit: 'cover'` for consistent image display

### 5. **Clean Production Code**
- Removed debug console logs
- Removed temporary debug components
- Cleaned up test files and comments

## 🎯 Final Status

### ✅ **Working Features:**
- ✅ Header image displays with fallback
- ✅ Photo grid with drag/drop upload
- ✅ Primary image selection
- ✅ Image error handling with fallbacks
- ✅ Responsive image loading
