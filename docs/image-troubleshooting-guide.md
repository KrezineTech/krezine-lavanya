# Image Display Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
I've implemented comprehensive fixes for image display issues in your product detail page. Here's what has been done:

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Image Error Handling**
- Added proper `onError` and `onLoad` handlers
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for failed image loads
- Added console logging for debugging image load/error events

### 2. **Updated Mock Data with Better Image Sources**
- Replaced `placehold.co` URLs with Unsplash images
- Added proper dimensions and crop parameters
- Used reliable image sources that should work with Next.js

### 3. **Improved Image Components**
- Added `unoptimized` flag for placeholder images
- Implemented `sizes` attribute for responsive images
- Added `priority` loading for important images (header and primary photos)

### 4. **State-Based Error Handling**
- PhotoGrid now tracks image errors in component state
- Header image has separate error state management
- Graceful fallback to "No Image" placeholders

### 5. **Debug Components**
- Created `ImageDebug` component for troubleshooting
- Added temporary debug section to the page
- Comprehensive logging for image load status

## üîç Debug Information Available

The page now includes a yellow debug section that shows:
1. **Unsplash Image**: Tests external image loading
2. **Via Placeholder**: Tests fallback image service
3. **Listing Image**: Tests the main listing image
4. **First Photo**: Tests photo grid images

## üöÄ Next Steps to Resolve

### Step 1: Check the Debug Section
Visit `http://localhost:3001/listings/1` and look at the yellow debug section:
- Which images show "Error" vs "Loading" vs actual images?
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Any error messages related to images
- Network tab to see HTTP status codes for image requests
- Any CORS or security errors

### Step 3: Test Basic Connectivity
Visit `http://localhost:3001/test-image-display.html` to test:
- Basic HTML image loading (without Next.js)
- Network connectivity to image services
- Firewall or proxy issues

### Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Images show "Error" in debug section
**Possible Causes:**
- Network/firewall blocking external images
- CORS issues with image sources
- Next.js configuration problems

**Solutions:**
- Check Next.js config has correct `remotePatterns`
- Try different image sources
- Test with `unoptimized={true}` on all images

#### Issue: Images show "Loading" forever
**Possible Causes:**
- Slow network connection
- Image URLs are incorrect
- DNS resolution issues

**Solutions:**
- Check image URLs in browser directly
- Try smaller image sizes
- Use local images for testing

#### Issue: Some images work, others don't
**Possible Causes:**
- Inconsistent image sources
- Some URLs require authentication
- Mixed HTTP/HTTPS content

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all URLs use HTTPS
- Check image source reliability
- Standardize on one image service

## üõ† Temporary Workarounds

If images still don't load, you can:

### Option 1: Use Local Images
```tsx
// Replace image URLs with local uploads
image: '/uploads/sample-image.jpg'
```

### Option 2: Disable Next.js Image Optimization
```tsx
// Add to all Image components
unoptimized={true}
```

### Option 3: Use Regular HTML Images
```tsx
// Replace Next.js Image with regular img tag
<img src={imageSrc} alt={alt} className={className} />
```

## üìù Files Modified

1. **`/src/app/(main)/listings/[id]/page.tsx`**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Updated mock data with Unsplash images
   - Added debug section
   - Improved PhotoGrid component

2. **`/src/components/ImageDebug.tsx`** (New)
   - Debug component for image testing
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Visual status indicators

3. **`/public/test-image-display.html`** (New)
   - Basic HTML image test page
   - No Next.js dependencies
   - Simple connectivity test

## üîß Next.js Configuration

Your `next.config.js` already includes the necessary domains:
- `images.unsplash.com`
- `via.placeholder.com`
- `placehold.co`
- Local uploads

## üí° Production Considerations

Before deploying:
1. **Remove Debug Section**: Delete the yellow debug section
2. **Remove Debug Component**: Remove `ImageDebug` imports and usage
3. **Remove Test Files**: Delete `test-image-display.html`
4. **Clean Console Logs**: Remove debugging console.log statements

## üìû Need Help?

If images still don't display after following these steps:
1. Share the browser console output
2. Share what you see in the debug section
3. Let me know which specific images are failing
4. Check if it's a network/firewall issue in your environment

The current implementation should work for most cases. The debug tools will help us identify the specific issue in your environment.
